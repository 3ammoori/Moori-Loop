# Moori Loop

A web-based pattern sequencer and drum machine application, it allows users to quickly create rhythmic and melodic loops on a step-sequencer grid. It features on-the-fly sound synthesis (for drums and simple bass/synth lines), adjustable BPM and sequence length, and includes a dynamic visualizer that responds to the beat. Users can play their creations in real-time, or export their patterns as a shareable JSON file or the complete mix as a WAV audio file.

## Features

- Step Sequencing: Create rhythmic patterns across 6 synthesis tracks (Kick, Snare, HiHat, Synth, Bass, Click).
- Real-Time Audio Synthesis: Sounds are generated directly in the browser using the Web Audio API.
- BPM Control: Adjustable tempo from 60 to 200 BPM.
- Dynamic Sequence Length: Change the number of steps from 4 up to 128.
- Visualizer: A reactive visual core provides visual feedback to the rhythm.
- Export/Import: Share patterns as JSON strings or export the entire loop as a high-quality WAV audio file.

- Note: The current features work well, which is the main thing. My to-do list for new ones is ambitious, but it currently lives in a complex symbiotic relationship with my motivation, free time, and the mysterious forces of procrastination. So, while I fully intend to add more, the schedule is "eventually". In the meantime, what's here is solid and ready to use, so, yeah.
